Deployment instructions:
1. Please run the git clone command (git clone https://github.com/ipluaws/ovalhr1.git)
2. Once clonning of the git repository has been completed, navigate to the repo.  
For terraform deployment of 3-tier sample web application, two environments has been created name 'dev' and 'prod'
proxy, db and backend - these 3 folders are for 3-tier web application containing dockerfile to run each one as a docker container
Kubernetes folder is containing all required .yamls to deploy the solution to Kubernetes 

3. Depends on your environment browse the directory (P.S: Please change the values in variables.tf file according to your requirements)
E.g: cd/ovalhr1/prod
- Run terraform init to initialize 
- Run terraform plan
- Run terraform Apply
- After successful execution of terraform apply command, please give couple of minutes then copy the 'ec2-public-ip' address from Outputs and paste into your browser

Since horizontal scaling is one of the main requirements, to scale up the service simply execute the following command:

Please execute:
$sudo docker service ls
